- fix upgrade tree UI

// make UpgradeTreeUI depend on the upgrade tree separately

- do upgrades work in a namespace? (static allocation / equality issues ???)

Tidy up:

- no need for specific game objects to have a virtual destructor - GameObject has one by contract
  - see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14281078/is-it-safe-to-not-specify-a-destructor-in-a-subclass-of-a-base-class-with-a-virt#comment19829212_14281119

- use static_weak_pointer_cast in *ObserverOf<T> classes
- rename: SelfReferencing<T> -> Referencing<T>
- make *ObserverOf<T>::*Model/Handler/Emitter() return a reference, not a shared_ptr
- Ship shouldn't be an ObjectEventCreator - it doesn't create object events, nor does it need the ref again

Next:

- merge controllers

---------------------------------------------

- Event
  - EventEmitter
    - HasEventEmitter
      - HasEventEmitterOf<A : EventEmitter> : HasEventEmitter
        - Controller<A : EventEmitter> : GameObject, HasEventEmitterOf<A>
          / --- Controller module
    - KeyMap
      - Controls
        - MyInputs
    - Timer

  - EventHandler
    - HasEventHandler
      - HasEventHandlerOf<A : EventHander> : HasEventHandler
